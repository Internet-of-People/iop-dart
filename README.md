# IOP SDK

This package contains Dart tools needed to interact with IOP SSI (project Morpheus) and DNS (project Coeus) and create awesome decentralized apps. For more info please visit the [IOP Developer Portal](https://developer.iop.technology).

This SDK is a work in progress and its convenience improves over time.

## Prerequisites

- Dart 2.12.0+
- Linux / MacOS

## Install

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  iop_sdk: ^5.0.0
```

## Architecture

#### Dynamic Libraries and OS Support

Most of the codebase is implemented in Rust and this Dart library uses [Dart FFI](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/c-interop) to communicate with a shared dynamic library generated from Rust using its C bindings. The native library binary is loaded dynamically on demand.

Currently, we support only Linux, MacOS and Android, but we are also preparing iOS and Windows support as well.

#### Memory Management

As Dart finalizers are [not ready yet](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/35770), only manual memory management is available. Consequently, some classes of this package are extended from `Disposable` and you have to manually dispose their instances when not using those objects anymore. This is common for Android developers, but might not be that evident for others.

## Modules

### Crypto

Cryptographic primitives mostly for creating a [vault](https://developer.iop.technology/glossary?id=vault) and generating a large set of purpose-specified private keys for Hydra addresses, SSI DIDs, etc. It also contains tools to sign and validate signatures based on DIDs with a managable keyset and easily handle JWT tokens.

### Entities

#### Authority

All interfaces and types that are needed to communicate with an [Authority](https://developer.iop.technology/glossary?id=authority) endpoint. Authorities have a public and a private API as described below.

See more about the Authorities API [here](https://developer.iop.technology/api/authority_api)

##### Public API

The Public API is available without authentication, mostly used by clients of the given authority's services.

##### Private API

The Private API is available with authentication only and used mostly by internal entities (e.g. clerks) of an authority.

#### Inspector

All interfaces and types needed to communicate with an [Inspector](https://developer.iop.technology/glossary?id=inspector) endpoint. See more about the Inspector API [here](https://developer.iop.technology/api/inspector_api).

#### Verifier

All interfaces and types needed to communicate with a [Verifier](https://developer.iop.technology/glossary?id=verifier) endpoint. See more about the Verifier API [here](https://developer.iop.technology/api/verifier_api).

### Layer1

SSI's API consists of two main parts. Layer-1 and layer-2. Layer-1 performs write operations that change the blockchain's state, while layer-2 executes queries (i.e. read operations without touching the state).

This module contains all Dart classes and utils needed to interact with the [SSI Layer-1 API](https://developer.iop.technology/api/layer1_api). 

For more detailed examples please visit our [tutorial center](https://developer.iop.technology/sdk?id=tutorial-center).

### Layer2

This module contains all Dart classes and utils needed to interact with the [Layer-2 API](https://developer.iop.technology/api/layer2_api). 

For more detailed examples please visit our [tutorial center](https://developer.iop.technology/sdk?id=tutorial-center).

### SSI

Contains all interfaces needed to use the SSI (project Morpheus) protocol including all entities defined in the specification.

## Development

```bash
# Build json converters
$ pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

```bash
# Run tests
$ pub run test --concurrency=1 # note: the test must run on a single thread becaus of nonce generation
```

```bash
# Run Analyzer
$ dartanalyzer .
```
